## NodeJS Hello World

A bare-bones docker ready nodeJS server for testing infrastructure and etc. The server responds 
with 'Hello World' for all requests which can be customized using the MESSAGE environment variable. Run `npm run start` 
to start the server and `npm docker-build` to build a docker image. There is no need to run `npm install`. The public dockerhub repository
can be found at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kevinwang5658/nodejs-hello-world.

Hope you enjoy!
